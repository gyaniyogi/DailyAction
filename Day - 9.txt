 Today's learning and observations from team members are as follows:	

	A. How to access the website from a local PC? (Kunal Sir)

		Make entry of ip add and fqdn name or alias of a domain into a host file

	B. How To transfer a domain to a new host? (Pushkar Sir)

		For example:
If The client wants to transfer a domain from the old host to the New host

Domain transfer is an automated process. 
The new host administrator generates a request for domain transfer
Then, the client will approve those requests.
Later, the old host will give approval, and finally domain will get transferred to the new Host

	C. Mail delivery issue

DKIM issue. finally, it was found that NameServer had been taken from another webhosting company. mail service is also from a third party.
